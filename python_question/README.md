## Mutable and Immutable Objects

### Mutable objects (call by reference):

list, dict, set, byte array

### Immutable objects (pass by value):
- int, float, complex, string, 

- tuple (the “value” of an immutable object can’t change, but it’s constituent objects can.), 

- frozen set [note: immutable version of set], 
- bytes

### Features:

- Python handles mutable and immutable objects differently.
- Immutable are quicker to access than mutable objects.
- Mutable objects are great to use when you need to change the size of the object, example list, dict etc.. Immutables are used when you need to ensure that the object you made will always stay the same.
- Immutable objects are fundamentally expensive to “change”, because doing so involves creating a copy. Changing mutable objects is cheap.

### How objects are passed to Functions

Its important for us to know difference between mutable and immutable types and how they are treated when passed onto functions. Memory efficiency is highly affected when the proper objects are used.

For example if a mutable object is called by reference in a function, it can change the original variable itself. 

Hence to avoid this, the original variable needs to be copied to another variable. Immutable objects can be called by reference because its value cannot be changed anyways.

## Ways to execute Python code: exec, eval, ast, code, codeop, etc.

The `exec(object, globals, locals)` method executes the dynamically created program, which is either a string or a code object. Returns `None`. Only side effect matters!

Example 1:
```python
program = 'a = 5\nb=10\nprint("Sum =", a+b)'
exec(program)
```
```bash
Sum = 15
```

Example 2:
```python
globals_parameter = {'__builtins__' : None}
locals_parameter = {'print': print, 'dir': dir}
exec('print(dir())', globals_parameter, locals_parameter)
```
```bash
['dir', 'print']
```

The `eval(expression, globals=None, locals=None)` method parses the expression passed to this method and runs python expression (code) within the program. Returns the value of expression!

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> eval('37 + a')   # it is an expression
42
>>> exec('37 + a')   # it is an expression statement; value is ignored (None is returned)
>>> exec('a = 47')   # modify a global variable as a side effect
>>> a
47
>>> eval('a = 47')  # you cannot evaluate a statement
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 1
    a = 47
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

If a `code` object (which contains Python bytecode) is passed to `exec` or `eval`, they behave identically, excepting for the fact that exec ignores the return value, still returning `None` always. So it is possible use `eval` to execute something that has statements, if you just compiled it into bytecode before instead of passing it as a string:
```python
>>> eval(compile('if 1: print("Hello")', '<string>', 'exec'))
Hello
>>>
```

`Abstract Syntax Trees`, ASTs, are a powerful feature of Python. You can write programs that inspect and modify Python code, after the syntax has been parsed, but before it gets compiled to byte code. That opens up a world of possibilities for introspection, testing, and mischief.

In addition to compiling source code to bytecode, `compile` supports compiling abstract syntax trees (parse trees of Python code) into `code` objects; and source code into abstract syntax trees (the `ast.parse` is written in Python and just calls `compile(source, filename, mode, PyCF_ONLY_AST))`; these are used for example for modifying source code on the fly, and also for dynamic code creation, as it is often easier to handle the code as a tree of nodes instead of lines of text in complex cases.

The `code` module provides facilities to implement read-eval-print loops in Python. Two classes and convenience functions are included which can be used to build applications which provide an **interactive interpreter prompt**.

The `codeop` module provides utilities upon which the Python read-eval-print loop can be emulated, as is done in the `code` module. As a result, you probably don’t want to use the module directly; if you want to include such a loop in your program you probably want to use the code module instead.

## Advanced differences  between 2.x and 3.x in general

### Division operator
If we are porting our code or executing python 3.x code in python 2.x, it can be dangerous if integer division changes go unnoticed (since it doesn’t raise any error). It is preferred to use the floating value (like 7.0/5 or 7/5.0) to get the expected result when porting our code. 
### `print` function
This is the most well-known change. In this, the print keyword in Python 2.x is replaced by the print() function in Python 3.x. However, parentheses work in Python 2 if space is added after the print keyword because the interpreter evaluates it as an expression. 
### Unicode
In Python 2, an implicit str type is ASCII. But in Python 3.x implicit str type is Unicode. 

### `xrange`
xrange() of Python 2.x doesn’t exist in Python 3.x. In Python 2.x, range returns a list i.e. range(3) returns [0, 1, 2] while xrange returns a xrange object i. e., xrange(3) returns iterator object which works similar to Java iterator and generates number when needed. 

### Error Handling
There is a small change in error handling in both versions. In python 3.x, ‘as’ keyword is required. 

### `_future_` module
The idea of the __future__ module is to help migrate to Python 3.x. 
If we are planning to have Python 3.x support in our 2.x code, we can use _future_ imports in our code. 

### Six
Six is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library. It provides utility functions for smoothing over the differences between the Python versions with the goal of writing Python code that is compatible on both Python versions. See the documentation for more information on what is provided.

## `deepcopy`, method `copy`, slicing, etc.
The `copy()` returns a shallow copy of list and `deepcopy()` return a deep copy of list.
Python `slice()` function returns a slice object. 

A sequence of objects of any type(`string`, `bytes`, `tuple`, `list` or `range`) or the object which implements `__getitem__()` and `__len__()` method then this object can be sliced using `slice()` method.

## OrderedDict, DefaultDict
An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were first inserted. The only difference between dict() and OrderedDict() is that:

`OrderedDict` preserves the order in which the keys are inserted. A regular dict doesn’t track the insertion order and iterating it gives the values in an arbitrary order. By contrast, the order the items are inserted is remembered by OrderedDict.

`Defaultdict` is a container like dictionaries present in the module collections. `Defaultdict` is a sub-class of the dictionary class that returns a dictionary-like object. The functionality of both dictionaries and defaultdict are almost same except for the fact that defaultdict never raises a KeyError. It provides a default value for the key that does not exists.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def def_value():
    return "Not Present"

d = defaultdict(def_value)
```

## `hashable()`

An object is hashable if it has a hash value that does not change during its entire lifetime. Python has a built-in hash method ( `__hash__()` ) that can be compared to other objects. For comparing it needs `__eq__()` or `__cmp__()` method and if the hashable objects are equal then they have the same hash value. All immutable built-in objects in Python are hashable like tuples while the mutable containers like lists and dictionaries are not hashable. 

`lambda` and user functions are hashable.

Objects hashed using `hash()` are irreversible, leading to loss of information.
`hash()` returns hashed value only for immutable objects, hence can be used as an indicator to check for mutable/immutable objects.

## Strong and weak typing

Python is strongly, dynamically typed.

* **Strong** typing means that the type of value doesn't change in unexpected ways. A string containing only digits doesn't magically become a number, as may happen in Perl. Every change of type requires an explicit conversion.
* **Dynamic** typing means that runtime objects (values) have a type, as opposed to static typing where variables have a type.

```python
bob = 1
bob = "bob"
```

This works because the variable does not have a type; it can name any object. After `bob = 1`, you'll find that `type(bob)` returns `int`, but after `bob = "bob"`, it returns `str`.

## Frozenset
The `frozenset()` function returns an immutable frozenset object initialized with elements from the given iterable.

Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python `set` object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.

Due to this, frozen sets can be used as keys in Dictionary or as elements of another set. But like sets, it is not ordered (the elements can be set at any index).

## Weak references
Python contains the ``weakref`` module that creates a weak reference to an object. If there are no strong references to an object, the garbage collector is free to use the memory for other purposes.

Weak references are used to implement caches and mappings that contain massive data.

## Raw strings

Python raw string is created by prefixing a string literal with ‘r’ or ‘R’. Python raw string treats backslash (\) as a literal character. This is useful when we want to have a string that contains backslash and don’t want it to be treated as an escape character.


## Unicode and ASCII strings	

Unicode is international standard where a mapping of individual characters and a unique number is maintained. As of May 2019, the most recent version of Unicode is 12.1 which contains over 137k characters including different scripts including English, Hindi, Chinese and Japanese, as well as emojis. These 137k characters are each represented by a unicode code point. So unicode code points refer to actual characters that are displayed.
These code points are encoded to bytes and decoded from bytes back to code points. Examples: Unicode code point for alphabet a is U+0061, emoji 🖐 is U+1F590, and for Ω is U+03A9.

The main takeaways in Python are:
1. Python 2 uses str type to store bytes and unicode type to store unicode code points. All strings by default are `str` type — which is bytes~ And Default encoding is ASCII. So if an incoming file is Cyrillic characters, Python 2 might fail because ASCII will not be able to handle those Cyrillic Characters. In this case, we need to remember to use decode("utf-8") during reading of files. This is inconvenient.
2. Python 3 came and fixed this. Strings are still `str` type by default but they now mean unicode code points instead — we carry what we see. If we want to store these `str` type strings in files we use bytes type instead. Default encoding is UTF-8 instead of ASCII. Perfect!
